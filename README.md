# 🎨 Artwork Authenticity Platform Using Blockchain

This project is a decentralized web application (DApp) that authenticates, manages, and transfers ownership of artworks using blockchain technology. Built with a focus on **transparency, security, and decentralization**, it aims to eliminate fraud in the art market by providing immutable digital certificates of authenticity for each artwork.

## 📌 Overview

The platform provides role-based access for three main users:

- **Artists**: Add and manage their artworks, generate certificates of authenticity, and transfer ownership.
- **Clients**: Browse, purchase, and manage artwork ownership.
- **Administrators**: Monitor transactions, verify data, and manage the overall system.

Each artwork is registered on a **public blockchain (Ethereum)**, and all metadata is securely stored using **IPFS**. Ownership and authenticity are validated through **smart contracts**.
